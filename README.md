# GR1D

GR1D was originally created in p5.js for a personal project where I needed to draw a series of grid-based graphics. Creating different grid sizes repeatedly soon became tedious, so I built this tool to streamline the process. Within iterations, it started to feel fun to play with. It is a simple grid-based drawing Figma Plugin that combines the precision of geometric constraints with the freedom of creative expression.
